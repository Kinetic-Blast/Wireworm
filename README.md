# Wireworm
This Python script utilizes the `pywifi` library to scan and retrieve information about nearby Wi-Fi networks. The script provides details such as SSID, signal strength, BSSID (Basic Service Set Identifier), and wireless security protocols. Additionally, it attempts to retrieve vendor information based on the MAC address of each network.



Work in progress
More features are going to be added at a later date
